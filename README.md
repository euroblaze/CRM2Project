# Sharing Customer Requirements collected in CRM (sales phase) with Projects Module (projects phase)

This Odoo-based solution streamlines the process of transferring customer requirements in photovoltaic installation companies from the sales stage to the project stage. The solution includes modules for form building, sales, projects, communication, plausibility checks, and data integration.

## Modules

- Form Builder Module: Create custom forms to capture customer requirements during the pre-sales phase. [Available from AppStore](https://apps.odoo.com/apps/modules/15.0/formio/).
- Sales Module: Manage pre-sales activities, including the collection of customer requirements using forms created in the Form Builder Module.
- Projects Module: Manage project activities after the successful transfer of customer requirements from the Sales Module. Project managers review the data and communicate with salespeople for clarification if needed.
- Communication Module: Facilitate communication between salespeople and project managers by allowing project managers to request clarification from salespeople through checklists of data fields that require additional information.
- Plausibility Check Module: Validate customer requirements collected in the pre-sales phase by performing plausibility checks. Only validated data is allowed to be transferred to the Projects Module.
- Data Integration Module: Ensure that the data collected by the Form Builder Module is consistent and compatible between the Sales Module and the Projects Module.

## Installation

1. Clone or download the module to your Odoo addons folder.
2. Restart your Odoo server.
3. Go to the Apps menu in the Odoo web interface and click on "Update Apps List".
4. Search for the "Photovoltaic Installation Management System" module, then click on "Install".

## Usage

After installing the module, you can start using it to manage customer requirements and streamline the process from the sales stage to the project stage.

1. Use the Form Builder Module to create forms for capturing customer requirements.
2. In the Sales Module, use the created forms to collect customer requirements during the pre-sales phase.
3. The Plausibility Check Module validates the collected customer requirements before they are transferred to the Projects Module.
